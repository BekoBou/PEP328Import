# PEP328 Sample

I just try to understand how it works?

## Execute

This sample works on python 2.7 and python 3.

```
⋊> python --version
Python 2.7.13

⋊> python pep328.py
I see dead people! This's fine!
The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42
 
⋊> python3 --version
Python 3.6.0

⋊> python3 pep328.py
I see dead people! This's fine!
The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42
```
